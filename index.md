## The Nameless Pact

The purpose of the Nameless Pact is to omit the name and photo of mass-shooters from news coverage in attempts to prevent a copy cat. 

### Why The Nameless Pact

The unfortunate reality of our world today is that we are surrounded by hate. Specifically, in the US, we have grown numb to mass shootings where innocent people are murdered in our schools, Churches, and Synagogues. 

When news breaks of these deadly events, we all begin searching for details to help us grapple with the situation. Who did it? Where are they from? Was this person crazy? And really what we are subconsciouly doing is trying to find some bit of information that can help us understand _why_. _Why did this happen...? How could this happen...? There must be a reason..._ 

And medaia coverage in the aftermath of a deadly mass casualty event, begins to endlessly show the picture, name, age, city, ocupation, and other details of the alleged murderer. The unintended consequence of this coverage is a brief period of fame for the shooter which has been shown to lead to other copycat mass-casualty events. This has to stop.

In 2007, a Virginia Tech student killed 32 students and faculty at the university. 
Prior to the shooting, he expressed a desire in writing to repeat the shooting at Columbine. Since then, 
many shooters have cited the Virginia Tech gunman as an inspiration and others have threatened to kill 
more than the 32 victims killed.

While learning the name and details of the murderer seems like harmless news coverage, in many ways it agrandizes what they've done. Their story often repeats for days following the event, and this twisted "fame" is something that the killers desire, and can even inspire other shooters who try to out-do the original one by killing more people.

Studies indicate that the more media attention a shooter gets, the more likely the event will inspire a future mass shooter. For example, a 2015 study found that after a mass shooting, there was an increased chance of another one occurring in the next 13 days.[7] A 2017 study found that media coverage of a mass shooting may increase the frequency and lethality of future shootings, but the contagion period might not be within the first two weeks, but instead might inspire the frequency of mass shootings in the future.[8]
