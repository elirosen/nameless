## The Nameless Pact

The purpose of the Nameless Pact is to omit the name and photo of mass-shooters from news coverage in attempts to prevent a copy cat. 

### Why The Nameless Pact

The unfortunate reality of our world today is that we are surrounded by hate. Specifically, in the US, we have grown numb to mass shootings where innocent people are murdered in our schools, Churches, and Synagogues. 

When news breaks of these deadly events, we all begin searching for details to help us grapple with the situation. Who did it? Where are they from? Was this person crazy? And really what we are subconsciouly doing is trying to find some bit of information that can help us understand _why_. _Why did this happen...? How could this happen...? There must be a reason..._ 

And medaia coverage in the aftermath of a deadly mass casualty event, begins to endlessly show the picture, name, age, city, ocupation, and other details of the alleged murderer. The unintended consequence of this coverage is a brief period of fame for the shooter which has been shown to lead to other copycat mass-casualty events. This has to stop.
